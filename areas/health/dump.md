# being vulnerable
- Be vulnerable to be strong. Share your failures. And you will get the support needed.
	- But make sure your scars have healed, before opening out to people about it.

# benefits of physical workout
- i have been working out consistently for the last few months, almost 6 months, and the changes have been immense.
- it starts of a little slow and hard, and you don't see a lot of improvements at first, but you keep pushing.
- more than just looking great, below are some advantages that i found with physical workout -> 

## sleep schedule
- prior to doing regular workouts, my sleep schedule was all over the place.
- working till 11PM on weekdays and staying awake till 2AM on weekends, in search for some dopamine i guess
- but once i started working out, my body slowly adapted so that i am the most active in the morning during my workouts and naturally feel tired and sleepy as the day ends
- this helped me sync my sleep cycle and i have been continuously sleeping in the range of same hours.
- i have tried experimenting with polyphasic sleep cycles a little, and i still am experimenting, but what i have learned is sleep is of utmost importance to me besides physical health.
- if i don't have enough amount of sleep, i start getting weird thoughts like what is the meaning of this world, why are we here, all those existential kind of queries.
- i am not so sure why does sleep does that to me, but i have experimented enough to realise a good quality of sleep is super important to me.
- and physical workout just helps to bolster my sleep by syncing my body clock perfectly
## energy levels
- didn't workout this last one week, and my energy levels have been down in the drain
- i am coding while laying down on my bed, and not feeling energetic to do anything and just scrolling through reels
- i think the endorphins boost one gets post exercising is a great energy boost and awakener
- also once i started feeling more fitter, automatically my energy levels soared as well
- this is also due to all the chemicals released when you workout -> dopamine, noradrenaline, endorphins, etc ...
## getting fitter
- workout stresses your body
- which reacts and repairs itself making it stronger
- both physically and apparently even mentally

- these are the advantages i can think of at the moment.
- will keep on adding as i find more.
- all in all, physical workout has become the anchor around which i plan my whole day at the moment.

# fighting addiction
- you just got to fight it for **now**, for today
- and then repeat this every other day
- not have alcohol just now, just today, and repeat it every other day
# write frequently
- Write frequently. Nothing clears the mind as writing does.
