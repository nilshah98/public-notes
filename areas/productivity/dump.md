# 10 / 10 / 10 rule for tough decisions
- Follow the: https://www.fastcompany.com/3007613/10-10-10-rule-tough-decisions
- 10 minutes, 10 months, 10 years
- If you're finding it tough to make a decision, think about what you would feel if you go through with it, what would you feel after 10 minutes, 10 months, 10 years
- If you see that after 10 months or 10 years, you would be 100% positive of the decision, go for it.
- It is just the current 10 minutes future short term emotions clouding your decision 
# auxillary skills

- Just as in cooking there's the central element consisting of getting all the proportions right, the temperature right.
	- And then there are other auxiliary elements, which involve keeping your knives sharp, flames working, chopping the veggies right.
	- And these auxillary elements, are present in each work, whatever you do, and play an important part in getting the work done just perfectly.
	- The masalas and flame can only take you so long, if you have diced the potatoes a bit big. It's the same everywhere, auxillary functions plays an important role, once you're versed with the core function, get on to the auxillary ones.
	- Learned to cook, get the chopping right, the mashing right.
	- Learned to code, get the tools right, the key bindings, right.
# career review framework
- There are lot of things I expect from a job aside from money. At least in my early adult life I can afford to expect a lot of other things besides the money. Here is a list of things I look for in a job ⇒
	- Money → Some amount of money that can act as a safety net before I jump to another job which doesn't pay as much but is much more satisfying and intriguing. I was not born with a silver spoon so this is a critical criteria for me.
	- Knowledge → Am I learning enough on the job. While going into job every other day am I excited to learn about something new.
	- Satisfaction → Is the product I am building aligning with what goals I have set for the longer term ? Does the product I am working on quench my thirst of meaningful contribution to the society.
-   When the job isn't satisfying either of the 3 items, in both the short and the near future terms, it is time to talk with your superiors or twist to another job.

# control over outcome
- When doing tasks whose outcomes are not controlled by you don't rely on those outcomes for making judgements.
- Example - Don't say I will keep on playing chess till I reach 800 elo tonight. That is just dumb, if you keep on losing you get frustrated don't learn anything and get farther away from your target.
- Rather find some other criteria which is under your control to judge if to stick or twist. In the above example can change it to, play 5 games and then stop, whatever the elo you currently are on.

# eat that frog
- start your day with the toughest task, and watch your day become gradually easier.
	- when i start my day, i have the most energy and it is easier to get by with the toughest task, like going for a run, or a gym or solving that problem which requires 30mins just to set things up
# feynmanns technique
- [Feynmann's Technique](https://fs.blog/feynman-technique/), is a learning technique, consisting of the below 4 core points -
	1. Select a concept to learn.
	2. Teach it to a child.
	3. Review and refine your understanding.
	4. Organize your notes and revisit them regularly.
- While reading books or learning anything. At the very end of a session try to explain yourself what you've just read or listened as it will help you both articulate things better and help to fill in the missing gaps of knowledge.
- When we speak without jargon it frees us from hiding behind knowledge we don't have

# hemingways bridge
- Note: This will be my own version of how I use the Hemmingway's Bridge technique as described in [[building a second brain - tiago forte]]
- Whenever I start a work session, I keep it short of 25 mins, as per the [[05022024_pomodoro_time_management]].
- And I apply the hemmingway's bridge towards the end of the session(*s*)
- I answer the below prompts -
	- What did I do during this session ?
	- What were the learning from this session ?
	- What needs to be done for the future session
- Our of these the 3rd question - `What needs to be done for the future session`, is the most important part, and the bridge that connects my two work sessions.
- During the end of my session, I am in flow, and I am aware of what needs to be done for the next steps, and what are the crucial ideas. And just jotting them down, helps me start exactly from where I left in the last session.
- I do this consistently on my calendar, where I mark my work sessions, and note down the answers to the 3 questions posed above.
- This also helps me get a broader picture of the whole work session, and helps me maintain my flow state and not lose crucial ideas.
# learning something new
1. A quick google search / llm based search to get an overview of things
2. Teach other folks, or teach yourself by writing it down
3. If you miss something, note it down, then rinse and repeat from 1.
# pomodoro for time management
- Technique -
	- Set timers of 25 minutes
	- Followed by 5 minutes interval
	- After 4 pomodoros, take a break of 25 minutes.
	- Configure the time slots that work well for you
- During the 5 minute interval →
	- Collect all your thoughts on what has been covered.
	-   Jot down further questions if any
	-   Get a more wider perspective of things
	- Do a quick workout HIIT
	-   Context switching can take time or even lose focus so refrain from lingering onto something else entirely like social media
-   During the 25 minute interval, can watch something or take a nap or exercise. Basically something different from what you were doing.

# 80-20 rule
- The 80/20 Rule is the best way to optimise life. Practise action, not perfection
- done is better than perfect
# timeboxing things
- timeboxing things. 
	- as mentioned in my other posts, most of the times you won't have control over the outcome of things.
	- hence, it is hard to know when to stop or take a pause.
	- timeboxing helps in that, stop / pause, get a new perspective and then start again with new vigor.
	- you can even try doing short bursts of exercises during these pauses, to help with the endorphins release
# tracking
- Track yourself, your action, and your habits.
- You can't improve something, that you can't measure.
# willingness to look foolish

- Aikido instructor George Leonard on the willingness to look foolish:
	- "It's possible that one of the reasons you got on the path of mastery was to look good. But to learn something new of any significance, you have to be willing to look foolish...  
	- When a Most Valuable Player candidate misjudges a ball and falls on his duff, he does it in the sight of millions. You should be willing to do it before your teacher and a few friends or fellow students. If you're always thinking about appearances, you can never attain the state of concentration that's necessary for effective learning and top performance."
  - Never be afraid to ask questions for the fear of looking foolish.
  - Even if it is the most basic of the questions, ASK!
  - This might spur a chain reaction and encourage others to ask more such questions, and this exploration might lead to a solid answer, with a resounding support and not a meh acceptance.
# self control
- self-control is the ability to resolve conflicts between your short-term and long-term goals.
- glucose is consumed by the brain during effortful activity. self-control is effortful, therefore there may be a resource constraining self-control. but, it’s not so simple:
- your beliefs about effort influence the amount you can produce. those with “limited” theories of self-control tend to have more conflicts than those with “non-limited” theories.
- habits reduce self-control required. the more automatic a decision, the less self-control required.
- don’t try to suppress your thoughts. they tend to rebound later in what is known as ironic processing.
- self-control probably isn’t a muscle you can train. it suffers from the same issues of transfer that plague other learning efforts, so being disciplined about one thing may not transfer to other things.
## strategies
1. increasing the value difference between the temptation and the goal reduces the need for self-control. (i.e. make the temptation less tempting, or the goal more motivating)
2. want-to goals are easier to pursue and result in more success than have-to goals.
3. find a way to do the task that combines something you want with the thing you have to do.
4. temptation bundling pairs a goal you have with an indulgence you enjoy. if you link them tightly you can make the goal more fun.
5. increasing psychological connectedness (the connection between your current and future self) also improves willpower.
6. changing how you think of yourself, through action and affirmation, can also change your identity. adjusting your identity can make self-control easier by becoming the kind of person who wouldn’t succumb to temptations.
7. switching to a high-level of construal while facing problems can prevent you from slipping. thinking about your goals and more abstract ideals prevent momentary lapses in self-control.
8. reappraising the activities you have to do, or the ones you’re trying to avoid can also make it easier to apply self-control. 
9. practicing mindfulness, allowing temptations to come and go without reacting to them, can also improve your self-control.

- seek ground truth and poke reality. don’t settle for proxies or for winning arguments.
- even if high level intuition is right, without grounding actionable implications likely completely wrong.
- strong intuition doesn’t mean intuition is right.
- working on the hardest problems requires incredible amount of courage. acknowledge & embrace fear.
- seek out weirdest people at parties.
- don’t be ashamed to ask “what do you do?” as the first question at parties.

- let people tell you no. don’t make the decision for them.
- for decisions: autoresolve (1) on specific date (2) to the scary one
- be as specific as possible. “agi takeoff fast”: define “agi” “takeoff” “fast”

# 100 tips for better life
1. Things you use for a significant fraction of your life (bed: 1/3rd, office-chair: 1/4th) are worth investing in.
3. Establish clear rules about when to throw out old junk. Once clear rules are established, junk will probably cease to be a problem. This is because any rule would be superior to our implicit rules (“keep this broken stereo for five years in case I learn how to fix it”).
4. When buying things, time and money trade-off against each other. If you’re low on money, take more time to find deals. If you’re low on time, stop looking for great deals and just buy things quickly online.
5. Food actually can be both cheap, healthy, tasty, and relatively quick to prepare. All it requires is a few hours one day to prepare many meals for the week.
6. Food taste can be made much more exciting through simple seasoning. It’s also an opportunity for expression. Buy a few herbs and spices and experiment away.
7. Advanced search features are a fast way to create tighter search statements. For example:
8. You can automate mundane computer tasks with Autohotkey (or AppleScript). If you keep doing a sequence “so simple a computer can do it”, make the computer do it.
9. Done is better than perfect.
10. Keep your desk and workspace bare. Treat every object as an imposition upon your attention, because it is. A workspace is not a place for storing things. It is a place for accomplishing things.
11. Reward yourself after completing challenges, even badly.
12. Discipline is superior to motivation. The former can be trained, the latter is fleeting. You won’t be able to accomplish great things if you’re only relying on motivation.
13. You can improve your communication skills with practice much more effectively than you can improve your intelligence with practice. If you’re not that smart but can communicate ideas clearly, you have a great advantage over everybody who can’t communicate clearly.
14. You do not live in a video game. There are no pop-up warnings if you’re about to do something foolish, or if you’ve been going in the wrong direction for too long. You have to create your own warnings.
15. The best advice is personal and comes from somebody who knows you well. Take broad-spectrum advice like this as needed, but the best way to get help is to ask honest friends who love you.
16. Make accomplishing things as easy as possible. Find the easiest way to start exercising. Find the easiest way to start writing. People make things harder than they have to be and get frustrated when they can’t succeed. Try not to.
17. Cultivate a reputation for being dependable. Good reputations are valuable because they’re rare (easily destroyed and hard to rebuild). You don’t have to brew the most amazing coffee if your customers know the coffee will always be hot.
18. Noticing biases in others is easy, noticing biases in yourself is hard. However, it has much higher pay-off.
19. Explaining problems is good. Often in the process of laying out a problem, a solution will present itself.
20. Foolish people are right about most things. Endeavour to not let the opinions of foolish people automatically discredit those opinions
21. Selfish people should listen to advice to be more selfless, selfless people should listen to advice to be more selfish. This applies to many things. Whenever you receive advice, consider its opposite as well. You might be filtering out the advice you need most.
22. There is no interpersonal situation that can’t be improved by knowing more about your desires, goals, and structure. ‘Know thyself!’
23. If you’re under 90, try things.
24. Things that aren’t your fault can still be your responsibility.
25. Defining yourself by your suffering is an effective way to keep suffering forever (ex. incels, trauma).
26. Don’t confuse ‘doing a thing because I like it’ with ‘doing a thing because I want to be seen as the sort of person who does such things’
27. Events can hurt us, not just our perceptions of them. It’s good to build resilience, but sometimes it isn’t your fault if something really gets to you
28. Personal epiphanies feel great, but they fade within weeks. Upon having an epiphany, make a plan and start actually changing behavior.
29. Sometimes unsolvable questions like “what is my purpose?” and “why should I exist?” lose their force upon lifestyle fixes. In other words, seeing friends regularly and getting enough sleep can go a long way to solving existentialism.
30. “If they’ll do it with you, they’ll do it to you” and “those who live by the sword die by the sword” mean the same thing. Viciousness you excuse in yourself, friends, or teammates will one day return to you, and then you won’t have an excuse.
31. You will prevent yourself from even having thoughts that could lower your status. Avoid blocking yourself off just so people keep thinking you’re cool.
32. Think a little about why you enjoy what you enjoy. If you can explain what you love about Dune, you can now communicate not only with Dune fans, but with people who love those aspects in other books.
33. When you ask people, “What’s your favorite book / movie / band?” and they stumble, ask them instead what book / movie / band they’re currently enjoying most. They’ll almost always have one and be able to talk about it.
34. Sometimes things last a long time because they’re good (jambalaya). But that doesn’t mean that because something has lasted a long time that it is good (penile subincisions). Apply this to relationships, careers, and beliefs as appropriate.
35. If you have trouble talking during dates, try saying whatever comes into your head. At worst you’ll ruin some dates (which weren’t going well anyways), at best you’ll have some great conversations. Alcohol can help.
36. When dating, de-emphasizing your quirks will lead to 90% of people thinking you’re kind of alright. Emphasizing your quirks will lead to 10% of people thinking you’re fascinating and fun. Those are the people interested in dating you. Aim for them.
37. People can be the wrong fit for you without being bad. Being a person is complicated and hard.
38. Compliment people more. Many people have trouble thinking of themselves as smart, or pretty, or kind, unless told by someone else. You can help them out.
39. If somebody is undergoing group criticism, the tribal part in you will want to join in the fun of righteously destroying somebody. Resist this, you’ll only add ugliness to the world. And anyway, they’ve already learned the lesson they’re going to learn and it probably isn’t the lesson you want.
40. Don’t punish people for trying. You teach them to not try with you. Punishing includes whining that it took them so long, that they did it badly, or that others have done it better.
41. Remember that many people suffer invisibly, and some of the worst suffering is shame. Not everybody can make their pain legible.
42. Don't punish people for admitting they were wrong, you make it harder for them to improve.
43. Human mood and well-being are heavily influenced by simple things: Exercise, good sleep, light, being in nature. It’s cheap to experiment with these.
44. You have vanishingly little political influence and every thought you spend on politics will probably come to nothing. Consider building things instead, or at least going for a walk.
45. Sturgeon’s law states that 90% of everything is crap. If you dislike poetry, or fine art, or anything, it’s possible you’ve only ever seen the crap. Go looking!
46. You don’t have to love your job. Jobs can be many things, but they’re also a way to make money. Many people live fine lives in okay jobs by using the money they make on things they care about.
47. Some types of sophistication won’t make you enjoy the object more, they’ll make you enjoy it less. For example, wine snobs don’t enjoy wine twice as much as you, they’re more keenly aware of how most wine isn’t good enough. Avoid sophistication that diminishes your enjoyment.
48. If other people having it worse than you means you can’t be sad, then other people having it better than you would mean you can’t be happy. Feel what you feel.
49. Liking and wanting things are different. There are things like junk food that you want beyond enjoyment. But you can also like things (like reading) without wanting them. If you remember enjoying something but don't feel a desire for it now, try pushing yourself.
50. People don’t realize how much they hate commuting. A nice house farther from work is not worth the fraction of your life you are giving to boredom and fatigue.
51. There’s some evidence that introverts and extroverts both benefit from being pushed to be more extroverted. Consider this the next time you aren’t sure if you feel like going out.
52. Bad things happen dramatically (a pandemic). Good things happen gradually (malaria deaths dropping annually) and don’t feel like ‘news’. Endeavour to keep track of the good things to avoid an inaccurate and dismal view of the world.
