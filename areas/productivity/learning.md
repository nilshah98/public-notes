1. Your brain creates synapses whenever you learn something new. Sleeping helps "update" your brain cells. Literally.
2. Learning a new thing or doing something you would rather not do can be stressing. This can cause anxiety at first. This activates the area associated with pain in the brain.

Your brain looks for a way to stop that negative feeling by switching your attention to something else more pleasant. 3. The trick is to just start. Researchers discovered that not long after people start actually working out what they didn’t like, that neuro-discomfort disappeared. 4. The more abstract something is, the more important it is to practice to create and strengthen neural connections to bring the abstract ideas to reality for you. 5. When you learn something new, make sure to take time to rest, then come back to it and recall what you learnt.

This is very important. Don’t cram information in one day. This leads to inefficient learning. It’s like building a wall without letting it dry.

Revisiting and practicing what you learn is important. Research shows that spaced repetition (repeating things after few days) is the best way to build and strengthen the synaptic connections. 6. Sleep is very important. It clears the metabolic toxins from the brain after a day of "brain use". It is best to sleep directly after learning new things. 7. It was shown that exercising and/or being in a rich social environment helps your brain produce new neurons. Don’t lock yourself in your room. Stay active and spare time for exercise (including general physical activities) and friends daily. 8. Chunking is the act of grouping concepts into compact packages of information that are easier for the mind to access. 9. Example: If you understand and practice a math formula. You no longer will need to focus much to solve it like you did the first time. That’s because your "formula chunk" got so abstracted into your brain that it can only take one slot of your working memory to solve it. 10. Turn off distractions. You want to use all the four slots of your working memory when studying. Learning will be inefficient if some of those slots are connected to something else. 11. You have to solve the problem yourself. Just because you see it, or even understand it, doesn't mean that you will be able to solve it (Illusion of competence). It is always easier to look at the material, even if you think it’s easy, then doing it yourself. 12. It gets easier. When you think that a chapter or a book has too much information and that there’s no way to go through them all; just focus on whatever section you’re studying. You’ll find that once you put that first concept in your mental library, the following one will be easier.

This concept is called Transfer; a chunk you have mastered in one area can often help you much more easily learn other chunks of information in different areas. 13. Master the major idea and then start getting deeper. However, make sure not to get stuck in some details before having a general idea. Practice to help yourself gain mastery and sense of the big picture context. Try taking a "picture walk" before you dig through the material, this means, look briefly at the pictures, chapter titles, formulas used… before diving into details. 14. Recall mentally without looking at the material. This is proven more effective than to simply rereading. Reread only after you try to recall and write down what was in the material. 15. Test yourself to make sure you are actually learning and not fooling yourself into learning. Mistakes are a good thing. They allow you to catch illusions of competence. 16. Don’t always trust your initial intuition. Einstellung problem (a German word for Mindset). An idea or a neural pattern you developed might prevent a new better idea from being found. Sometimes your initial intuition on what you need to be doing is misleading.You’ve to unlearn old ideas and approaches as you are learning new ones. 17. Mix up the problems (Interleaving) from different chapters. This is helpful to create connections between your chunks. It can make your learning a bit more difficult, but it helps you learn more deeply. Interleaving is very important. It is where you leave the world of practice and repetition, and begin thinking more independently. 18. Highlighting too much and creating maps are often ineffective without recalling. 19. Repeating something you already learnt or know very well is easy. It can bring the illusion of competence; that you’ve mastered the full material when you actually just know the easy stuff. Balance your studies and focus on the more difficult (deliberate practice). This sets the difference between a good student and a great student. 20. A big mistake is to blindly start working on an exercise without reading the textbook or attending the class. This is a recipe of sinking. It’s like randomly allowing a thought to pop off in the focus mode without paying attention to where the solution truly lies. 21. Unlike procrastination which is easy to fall into, Willpower is hard to come by. It uses a lot of neural resources and you shouldn’t waste it on fending off procrastination except when really necessary. You actually don’t need to. 22. Neuro-scientifically speaking, chunking is related to habit. 23. Habit is an energy saver. You don’t need to focus when performing different habitual tasks 24. The cue: The trigger that launches you into zombie mode (habitual routine). 25. Location. Time. Feelings. Reaction to people or events 26. The routine: Routine you do in reaction to the cue. 27. You only need to use your willpower to change your reaction to the cues. 28. Actively focus on rewiring your old habits. 29. The reward: Habits exist because they reward us. 30. Give yourself bigger rewards for bigger achievements. But after you finish them. 31. The belief: To change your habits, you need to change your underlying belief. 32. Only once your brain starts expecting a reward will the important rewiring takes place that will allow you to create new habits. 33. Researchers showed that writing your daily list the evening before helps you accomplish them the next day. If you don’t write them down, they will take the valuable slots of memory. 34. Plan your finishing time, this is as important as planning your working time. 35. Work in the most important and most disliked task first, even if it’s only one pomodoro. 36. Take notes about what works and what doesn’t. 37. Have a backup plan for when you will still procrastinate. 38. You should realize that it’s perfectly normal to start a learning session with a negative feeling even if you like the subject. It’s how you handle those feelings that matters. 39. Solution: Focus on the process, not the product. The product is what triggers the pain that causes you to procrastinate. Instead of saying "I will solve this task today", put your best effort for a period of time continuously over the days. 40. Use your visual memory to remember things. 41. Keep repeating what you want to learn so that the metabolic toxins won’t suck away the neural patterns related to that memory. Spaced repetition is the key. 42. Flashcards help. Consider using Anki. 43. Handwriting helps you deeply convert what you are trying to learn into neural memory structures. 44. Create meaningful groups and abbreviations. 45. To remember numbers, associate them to memorable events. 46. Create mnemonic phrases from first letters of the words you want to remember. 47. Memory Palace Technique: Use a familiar place (like the blueprint of your house) and associate visual images of things you want to remember with physical places.

This is not easy. You’ll be very slow at first. But with practice, you’ll get better.

The more you practice your "memory muscle" the easier you’ll remember. 48. Exercising is by far more effective than any drug to help you learn better. It helps new neurons survive. 49. You learn complex concepts by trying to make sense out of the information you perceive. Not by having someone else telling it to you. 50. Deliberate practice is what helps the average brain lift into the realm of those naturally gifted. Practicing certain mental patterns deepens your mind. 51. Brilliant scientist like Ramón y Cajal, the father of neuroscience, or Charles Darwin, were not exceptionally gifted. The key to their success was perseverance, taking responsibility for their learning and changing their thoughts. 52. Take pride in the qualities you excel at. Tune people out if they try to demean your efforts. 53. Don’t fool yourself. Don’t blindly believe in your intellectual abilities. Having a team can bring those projections down. 54. Explaining yourself to others helps you understand more.

## Notes

## Procrastination

### Why do we procrastinate ?

1.  Learning a new thing or doing something you would rather not do can be stressing. This can cause anxiety at first. This activates the area associated with pain in the brain.

Your brain looks for a way to stop that negative feeling by switching your attention to something else more pleasant. 2. This is with relation to learning, but we procrastinate for other things in life as well. Basically our body and mind wants to conserve energy and relax as much as possible. 1. Tim Urban, puts it better as - "The Instant Gratification Monkey" in our brain. Which is thinking and behaving like primates, prioritizing the present, and focusing on doing the things that are easy and make the present fun, rather than the past.

```

```

### How to tackle procrastination ?

1.  The trick is to just start. Researchers discovered that not long after people start actually working out what they didn’t like, that neuro-discomfort disappeared.
    
2.  One more trick, referenced from the above video is to set deadlines, when there are deadlines involved the panic monster gets involved. But make sure that there are repercussions if those deadlines are not cleared, and you do not go on extending it. Which will make the brain more comfortable extending the deadline always, and keep on procrastinating.
    
3.  Unlike procrastination which is easy to fall into, Willpower is hard to come by. It uses a lot of neural resources and you shouldn’t waste it on fending off procrastination except when really necessary. You actually don’t need to.
    
    1.  Notes on willpower is for some other day, but the crux here is, willpower is like a muscle, and it gets drained and exhausted on continuous usage, and needs to be replenished. Also like a muscle willpower can be exercised to get more stronger, to last longer
        
        [Willpower is for Losers](https://youtu.be/k2Wcu6aGyz8)
        
4.  Give yourself bigger rewards for bigger achievements. But after you finish them.
    
5.  Have a backup plan for when you will still procrastinate.
    
6.  Focus on the process and not the product. Set a daily deadline for what is under your control _(the process)_ rather than setting deadline for the product. **Example:** I need to write an article for 2 hours today, rather than I need to finish an article today.
    

## Learning

### Chunking

1.  Chunking is the act of grouping concepts into compact packages of information that are easier for the mind to access. **Example:** If you understand and practice a math formula. You no longer will need to focus much to solve it like you did the first time. That’s because your "formula chunk" got so abstracted into your brain that it can only take one slot of your working memory to solve it.

2.  Sleep is very important. It clears the metabolic toxins from the brain after a day of "brain use". It is best to sleep directly after learning new things.

### Practice

1.  The more abstract something is, the more important it is to practice to create and strengthen neural connections to bring the abstract ideas to reality for you.

It is where you leave the world of practice and repetition, and begin thinking more independently.
6.  Repeating something you already learnt or know very well is easy. It can bring the illusion of competence; that you’ve mastered the full material when you actually just know the easy stuff. Balance your studies and focus on the more difficult (deliberate practice). This sets the difference between a good student and a great student.

    1.  Ref - the above willpower video, which validates turning off distractions all together provides you with more free brain capacity to utilize.
4.  Master the major idea and then start getting deeper. However, make sure not to get stuck in some details before having a general idea. Practice to help yourself gain mastery and sense of the big picture context. **Try taking a "picture walk" before you dig through the material, this means, look briefly at the pictures, chapter titles, formulas used… before diving into details.**
    1.  Cover the breadth, then get into the depth.
5.  A big mistake is to blindly start working on an exercise without reading the textbook or attending the class. This is a recipe of sinking. It’s like randomly allowing a thought to pop off in the focus mode without paying attention to where the solution truly lies.

## annotations
- very quickly identify what the foundational knowledge is.
- build a personal curriculum to become an expert and avoid the trap of
the expert beginner.
- sprint hard the first 15-20 hours to impress initial memory, then decelerate to a
more regular pace.
- whereas #3 is a
relatively novel interpretation of spaced repetition.
but at a more meta level, the unexpected takeaway is the vast majority of people
likely haven’t updated their mental model for learning in decades. (stop and
think for a moment on the last time you did this.)

## Annotations
1. First of all, what is it you want to work on?
2. The more specific you get, the more of an enormous, seemingly never-ending list you’ll get, but the quicker you’ll see progress with ticking things off.
3. Ask yourself what topic, and what level of detail you want to focus on
4. Identify what the impact will be if you do/don’t spend time on this thing
5. When did this first come up?
6. Does the length of time this has stood have a bearing on whether it should be a priority?
7. Note down if/when this will become a problem if you don’t learn it, and…
8. What’s the worst that can happen if you don’t invest time in this area?
9. Capture what you think is a realistic timescale for you to achieve the level that you need
10. It can be quite powerful when coupled with Lara Hogan’s favourite “what are you optimising for?” question as an overarching beacon
