1. do some physical exercise / workout / movement every single day
	1. sync body clock and helps maintaining sleep cycle => and good sleep in turn leads to better days for me
	2. increases your energy levels
	3. makes you fitter by stressing and repairing your body
		1. both physically and mentally
2. use as little as phone possible, and try to keep one phone free day in the week
	1. this will help your brain get more activated
	2. i have noticed myself getting dumber, forgetting things more often and being slower in arithematic whereas i used to do those things brilliantly when i was younger
	3. so using the phone a little lesser will stress my brain to work little harder
3. fasting, try to fast once a few weeks, or atleast once a month
	1. calibrate your food intake to the amount of physical workout you have done
	2. if you haven't worked out, but still eat a lot *(since your body expects you to workout and prepares for this)* , this will end up making you more fuller and bloated which is not a good feeling
	3. this will also help you cleanse your system and increase your willpower
	4. remember your willpower is a muscle
	5. do train it, but use it wisely as well
4. don't delay on your dreams, hobbies and wants indefinitely
	1. we are certain that we want to do some things, like i want to run a half marathon, cycle around mumbai, and a few other things
	2. but due to my job, family and other commitments i lose sight of the things that i actually want to do, and that i know i will like
	3. i often think about them on the weekends, and then just push that activity more into the future, once i have enough money, or once i have a certain title or so on and so forth
		1. the issue with this is, all of those items are dependent on external factors, earning money, getting a promotion, so and so forth and none of them are under your control
		2. the thing is, i know all of this and i still end up falling for this
	4. also taking a page from this advice, i finally ended up getting a tattoo, which i wanted to do for the longest.
	5. another item is to donate blood, which i will next year once the tattoo is a year old
	6. but the point being, don't delay your dreams for some external factors, live life!
5. no one owes you shit
	1. just because you have lived for 26 years on this planet working your ass off, doesn't get you entitled to rant and people to just take an earful
	2. or for your opinions to get heard even
	3. all too often, i get impatient and frustrated by this, i want people to show me respect, because i think i am entitled.
	4. but i am not
	5. i have stayed for 3 years at browserstack, so i think i am entitled to make decision here, and i am the smartest person in the room
	6. that led me to a heated argument with my TL and i was hell bent on proving him wrong
	7. no point in this
6. you can only control your actions and not the outcomes or what happens to you
7. be patient, live slowly
	1. i have realised life is slipping away fast and there are so many things that i want to do
	2. so i become hasty, and i mess up often
	3. so i do things quickly, without staying in the moment and savoring it, take eating for example
	4. i need to watch some youtube video when i am eating, because when can i next catchup on news or the latest content
	5. and also i need constant simulation, which is again tied in with this point
	6. be patient, and let folks finish their replies, i often reply too early
8. you and only you are responsible for your actions
