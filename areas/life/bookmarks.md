2. (Poem) Life
```
Enjoy yourself, it's later than you think.  
Enjoy yourself, while you're still in the pink.  
The years go by, as quickly as a wink.  
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself, it's later than you think.
- Guy Lombardo

5. (Poem) The road not taken
```
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;

Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,

And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.

I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.
- Robert Frost
