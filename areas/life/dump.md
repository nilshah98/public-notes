# about regrets
- Computer science professor Randy Pausch—who had recently received a terminal pancreatic cancer diagnosis—shares some advice two months before his death:  
  
  "It is not the things we do in life that we regret on our death bed. It is the things we do not. I assure you I've done a lot of really stupid things, and none of them bother me. All the mistakes, and all the dopey things, and all the times I was embarrassed — they don't matter. What matters is that I can kind of look back and say: Pretty much any time I got the chance to do something cool I tried to grab for it — and that's where my solace comes from."
# baselines
- I had read a quote a long time back, that it's easier to maintain not doing something at all than doing something just once.  
- The central idea here being that once you start giving yourself leeway for that one instance, you'll be more loose in the future and will give yourself more leeways than originally thought.  
- Why should the baseline be 0 ?  
- 0 hours of gaming, 0 hours of movie time, ...  
- Why not set the baseline at x and move forward from there ?  
- The same goes for life why should the baseline for my life be the starry, the amazing times I had in college?  
- Why not set the baseline to what it is now, and move ahead from there.
- Here the idea isn't about self control, it's more about not living in the past and learning to let go for a new start.  
- Although in the future you might need to reset the baselines, reset your priorities.
- I should start terming going to sleep peacefully at night a win as well. That'll start shifting my attitude towards doing more of it when late in the night
# ownership
- Violent conflict >>>>>>>> silent resentment.
- You need to take your own decisions or else it will be decided for you. And then there will be only others to blame. *That's how to waste a life.*
- Stand up for yourself. Even if it means disrespecting your parents.
- Always asks "What were the shortcomings in myself". Curse yourself before you curse the world.
- Take extreme ownership. Valid reasons don't help you move forward. Be unreasonable.
