## Who is this for?

Before you start raining down on me, let me make this clear, that this article isn't targeted for everyone. This is for the select few, as -

1. New to the web and or programming in general.
2. Have enough *(~1 year)* experience with web & programming, and 
    1. Are looking for jobs in general. **NOT** a framework specific job.
    2. Are already employed somewhere.

## Introduction

I am a last year computer science graduate who has been placed and has been coding for almost 2 years now. And many a times I have found myself getting entangled in this endless cycle, where I learn some framework or library, and then some cool feature or another cool framework or library comes out, and I jump to that. The whole while just skimming through tutorials and never really building anything. Finally, I decided to sit down and get some clarity to get myself out of this purgatory.

I have tried to learn React time, and again, right since my third year in college, I would learn it for couple of weeks straight, then would get caught up with some project or hackathon, and when I am back to learning React after couple of months hiatus, I see a new feature or framework, that is more shiny and run blind towards it to pursue it. And this loop continued well into the last year as well, even after I landed a job. And through these 2 years, I have very little to show of React, only 1-2 projects, which are shabbily coded and unfinished.

Finally, I decided to put my foot down, and end this mindless binging of tutorials of new and more shiny framework and get a new perspective around this situation. So, here are my thoughts about the same.

## What are frameworks and libraries?

Essentially framework, as the name suggests, gives you a frame, a certain set of rules to follow, and you have to put in the code. Framework will do all the calling, the deploying, the injecting, you have to put in the code. So, the control here is with the framework.
Whereas, libraries are pieces of codes, objects and functions, provided by the library to you in a much simpler abstraction. This makes it much easier for you to write certain thing, which would otherwise have been 100's of lines long. Here, the  control is with you, the calling of functions, deploying, injecting.
That's the essential difference between framework and library, the [inversion of control](https://www.programcreek.com/2011/09/what-is-the-difference-between-a-java-library-and-a-framework/). 

### Frontend frameworks & libraries

Frontend libraries and framework, are used for a lot of stuff, right from writing reusable components, to having smooth animations, to super performant code. Libraries and framework have it all, allowing you to spin up things in minutes that would otherwise have taken hours to code. There are all many frontend libraries and frameworks out there the famous ones being -

1. React
2. Angular
3. Vue
4. Svelte

## Why you should NOT learn them?

### 1. Remember the basics

If you are have just started to learn coding, this is a major reason, to skip these libraries and frameworks. As stated earlier, these libraries and frameworks, make it a lot easier to code things, that would have otherwise taken hours to code. Although, this is great from time saving aspect, but it starves the coder from getting into the basics.
Example → If a coder is getting started with frontend development, DOM [Document Object Model] is absolutely essential, and how they are used to construct web pages. Skipping directly to libraries such as React, starves you of getting into these core basics. 

### 2. Constantly changing and volatile ecosystem

Particularly aimed at Javascript frontend frameworks & libraries, yes you. They are evolving FAST. Every other month, you see a more shinier framework or library, or a more advanced feature. They just evolve so fast.
And it may so happen, you nicely get adept at these libraries & frameworks today, added them to your skillset, but never really used them. Your current job depends on a completely different language, and you barely manage to make time for personal projects. And by the time you are back in the market or looking to upskill, and try to get started at that library or framework again. You see that there is lot of new stuff to learn, to get back at the earlier skill level.
That's what happened with me, with regards to React, when they moved from class based to function based syntax, it just moves so fast! And angular folks have had even worse time, since there are breaking changes in their updates.

### 3. Fundamentals of the Web remain the same

This is a BIG point. Master the fundamentals of the web, how they work, how the blocks fit together. These first principles won't change through time, and be there in place, until something entirely revolutionary comes through.
On the frontend side of things, master the browser, it is your WHOLE world. Learn how browsers work, how does it go about to actually display web pages, what are the different hooks that they provide and how can you plug into them, what are developer tools, how to make best use of them. These are the absolute basics and aren't changing anytime soon. Moreover they help you build a strong foundation.

### 4. Not the need of the hour

According to your situation you might have different needs, asses them, evaluate them, and then move forward, don't directly dive into it like it's some shiny object. As for me, the stack on my job is variable, nothing is fixed. Before thinking about this clearly I was going to dive in again, and learn React again this time,  more thorough. But I gave myself some time to think. And I realized that even if I learn it well, I don't see myself using it anywhere in the next 2-3 months. If some personal project does come up, I know the absolute basics, and they should be good enough to spawn up a minimal viable product. So, it didn't make sense to me, to dive into React right now, only to return to it 2-3 months later, when the landscape is very different.
So, think, and think deeply before you decide to delve into some library or framework.

## What should you learn then?

### [Basic] Language

- What are variables, data types and operators ?
- What are conditional statements and loops ?
- What are functions ?

### [Intermediate] Programming paradigms

There are a whole lot of programming paradigms out there, the most famous ones being → Object Oriented Programming and Functional Programming. The latter one gained impetus in the past few months.

Object Oriented Programming

- What are classes and methods ?
- What are objects ?
- What are constructors and destructors ?
- What is inheritance ?
- What is polymorphism ? → method overloading and overriding
- Access Control Modifiers

Functional Programing

- Immutability
- First class and higher order functions
- Currying
- Referential Transparency

### [Intermediate] Design patterns

In software engineering, a design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. They are a basic idea around which a solution can be built. The biggest advantage for Design Patterns being, they have been tested and proven to be effective over the years. This also helps you get rid of spaghetti code and write clean code that can be understood by your peers. Some of the basic design patters are →

Creational Pattern

- Abstract Factory, families of product objects
- Builder, how a composite object gets created
- Factory Method, subclass of object that is instantiated
- Prototype, class of object that is instantiated
- Singleton, the sole instance of a class

Behavioral Pattern

- Chain of Responsibility, object that can fulfill a request
- Command, when and how a request is fulfilled
- Interpreter, grammar and interpretation of a language
- Iterator, how an aggregate's elements are accessed

Structural Pattern

- Adapter, interface to an object
- Bridge, implementation of an object
- Composite, structure and composition of an object
- Decorator, responsibilities of an object without subclassing

There are 24 basic design patterns in all, only a few of them have been listed above.

### [Pro] Be Curious!

I have only been coding for 2 years, so only have so many tips to offer. But before ending, a pro tip. Be Curious! You discover some website, some application, some software that intrigues you, dive into it and look at it's internals how they work. I bet you will learn a lot while reverse engineering the system and deciphering their secrets.

- Have tinkered with the web for sometime, and can't figure out how whatsapp web works, here's a head start → [Whatsapp-Web-Reveng](https://github.com/sigalor/whatsapp-web-reveng)
- Always curious about how youtube gets you your videos, trying to track them using Networks tab in your console and trying to download them, here's a head start → [Youtube-DL](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl)
